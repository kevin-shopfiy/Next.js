                        Tap is a platform for athletes to distribute NFTs to their fans IRL (in Real Life) and around the world.
                        As a fan, you can build collections of your favorite players' NFTs and prove your fandom to fellow fans and friends.
                        On blockchain, your NFTâ€™s are authenticated and verified as originating from the athletes themselves, they will have full visibility into who their biggest fans are in order to recognize and reward you for your loyalty.<br/><br/>
                                            
                        IRL: Tap utilizes a proprietary method for athletes to mint NFTs on-the-spot, just like giving an autograph. This in-person tap proves you had a face-to-face, real-life, interaction. These NFTs are FREE because collecting an autograph should never cost you money.<br/><br/>

                        Minting Link: Athletes are able to create minting links to distribute online so fans around the world can collect. These NFTs are affordable for all fans and can be acquired for $1.99.<br/><br/>
